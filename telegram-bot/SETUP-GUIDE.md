# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide: Enable Real Telegram Messaging

## Prerequisites ✅
- [x] Your bot is already coded and ready
- [x] You have a Telegram bot token from @BotFather
- [x] You have an n8n webhook URL

## Step 1: Make Your Server Public 🌐

### Option A: Use ngrok (Recommended for testing)
```bash
# Install ngrok if you haven't
npm install -g ngrok

# In terminal 1: Start your bot server
cd telegram-bot
npm start

# In terminal 2: Expose it publicly
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the public URL from ngrok (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

### Option B: Deploy to Railway/Fly.io (For production)
```bash
# Railway
railway login
railway init
railway up

# Or Fly.io
fly launch
fly deploy
```

## Step 2: Update Your Environment 📝

Edit your `.env` file:
```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=your_n8n_webhook_url_here
PUBLIC_URL=https://your-public-url.com
PORT=3000
```

## Step 3: Register Webhook with Telegram 🔗

### Method A: Use the built-in setup endpoint
1. Make sure your server is running: `npm start`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/setup` (or your public URL + /setup)
3. You should see: `{"success": true, "webhook": "https://..."}` 

### Method B: Manual webhook setup
```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<YOUR_PUBLIC_URL>/webhook/telegram"
```

## Step 4: Test Real Messaging! 💬

1. Open Telegram app
2. Search for your bot by username (from @BotFather)
3. Send `/start` 
4. Send any message like "What's Bitcoin price?"
5. Watch your server logs for activity!

## Expected Server Logs:
```
📨 Message from Alice (12345): What's Bitcoin price?
🔄 Forwarding to n8n: "What's Bitcoin price?"
✅ Received response from n8n: {"results": [...]}
📤 Sending response to Telegram
```

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Bot not responding?
1. Check server logs: `npm start`
2. Verify webhook: `curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo`
3. Test health: `curl <YOUR_PUBLIC_URL>/health`

### n8n not working?
1. Test the n8n URL directly
2. Check your n8n webhook configuration
3. Verify the n8n workflow is active

### Need to reset webhook?
```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/deleteWebhook"
```
Then set it up again.
